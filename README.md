# realmeme SuperFART Rebooted

This is a community Discord bot project based on the repo [davwheat/realmeme-superfart-discord-bot](https://github.com/davwheat/realmeme-superfart-discord-bot), and was re-coded based on the repo [hackerman14/bot-codes](https://github.com/hackerman14/bot-codes), although not all commands remain the same or still exists, but I'll try my best to make all commands alive again in a form of slash commands.

## Self Hosting

Yes you can, I don't recommend you doing so as this is a community-focused bot (which is dedicated to [r/realme Community](https://discord.gg/MkpFgNuaYu)), but here are a few simple steps:
1. Install all packages in `package.json`
2. Put your API Tokens/Keys/IDs in `.env` (I've explained what you should put in the file via the file itself)
3. Run `node index.js` to start the bot and `node deploy.js` to deploy the commands.
